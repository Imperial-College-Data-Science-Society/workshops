    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this short crash course we will learn to code in Python programming language, specifically we will use Python 3, while searching on the internet you may sometime stumble upon Python 2.7. There are a few syntactic differences you will learn along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* General-purpose language, used in web developement as well as high performance computing\n",
    "* It is an \"interpreted\" programming language, i.e. there is no need to compile your code\n",
    "* Extensive choice of libraries to deal with most complicated problems, especially for data science and machine learning\n",
    "* Is easy to read and write (closer to english than other programming languages)\n",
    "* Very well documented, and widely used ([docs.python.org](http://docs.python.org) or check Stack Overflow)\n",
    "* Dynamically-typed - it is not necessary to manually define the types of variables (in most cases)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamically-typed - it is not necessary to manually define the types of variables - this can cause confusion. It is good practice to leave comments with description of the input for every function\n",
    "* Is slower than compiled languages, this can be rectified by using libraries that are pre-combiled in other programming languages (*More in the workshop on scientific computing in python)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan for today\n",
    "1. Basics: variables, conditional statements, for/while loops, functions \n",
    "2. Pythonic basics: list comprehension, lambda functions\n",
    "3. Problem solving\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to learn Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is a language, the only way to learn it is to speak it. *Don't be afraid, make mistakes, and ask questions.*\n",
    "* *Practice makes perfect*. Initially you will be forgetting the commands, the more you practice the sooner you will remember the syntax.\n",
    "* If you don't understand something, first compose the question properly, think about it, and if you can't think of a solution ask someone!\n",
    "* Before you execute any cell, stop and try to predict what it will do! Ideally write your prediction on a piece of paper!\n",
    "* Experiment! Change the code in the cells, try various test cases to understand how the code behaves."
